<ul>
<li>The maximum number of parallel runs is the number of threads in this computer (auto detect by R-SWAT). Please check how much memory and CPU usage you need for each simulation. Then you can select the optimal number of threads. You can check this manually by runing your SWAT (in the way that you have done) project and see changes in CPU and Memory (see Task Manager if you used Window)</li>
<li>If your number of parallel runs (threads) is 4 and the number of iterations is 11, then R-SWAT will run 2 iterations (which is integer of 11/4) on each thread, the last thread will run 2 + 3 (remainder of 11/4) = 5 iterations</li>
